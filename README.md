# FCW_NEWSLETTER

**Introduction**

FCW wamco a company known for their production in houshold eating product like Peak Milk and Three Crown. They had a challenge, they wanted to see how they can track their daily product representation performance and to do this they required the help of a data analyst to not only gather the data but also visualise it

**Data Preparation:**

The inspiration for this project struck when I came across a video article mentioning Netflix's release of viewership data for the year. Intrigued, I promptly visited the Netflix website and downloaded the dataset.

 


**Data Processing:**

Eagerly delving into the data analysis, I quickly realized that the task at hand was more challenging than anticipated. While the dataset was excellent, I sensed a need for additional elements to breathe life into it. Returning to the drawing board, I conceptualized and implemented the insertion of new columns, including GENRE, CATEGORY, and COUNTRY PRODUCED.


 
**Data Cleaning:**

As the dataset underwent evolution, two crucial goals were identified to ensure its completeness:
1.	The original Netflix dataset comprised 17,000 rows, and upon validating its integrity, I discovered a concerning issue with the 'year release' column, containing 10,000 missing values. To address this challenge and meet project deadlines, I took the following steps:
 



   - Reduced the dataset to its top 10% for analysis.
   - Filled in missing values using resources from websites such as WHATâ€™S ON NETFLIX.COM and NEWONNETFLIX.COM.
   
2. The second goal involved handling missing values in the newly created columns, which was successfully accomplished with the assistance of IMDB and ROTTENTOMATOES.
