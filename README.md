# FCW NEWSLETTER

**Introduction**

FCW WAMCO, a company renowned for its production of household food products such as Peak Milk and Three Crown, faced a significant challenge. They needed a way to track the daily performance of their product representation across over 100+ outlets in 10 regions. To address this, they sought the expertise of a data analyst to not only gather the necessary data but also visualize it effectively.

**Data Preparation:**

To begin the data collection process, a form was essential. KoboToolbox, an e-form generating web application, was utilized to create a comprehensive form that captured all the required data. Additionally, a training program was conducted to educate field staff on how to navigate and use the form efficiently. This ensured a smooth start to the project.

**Data Processing:**

To minimize human error and ensure data accuracy, the collected data was meticulously cleaned using Microsoft Excel. The focus was on identifying and addressing:
   - Outliers in the recorded figures
   - Cells with error messages due to incorrect data entry

1. **Outliers**: These were identified as entries that significantly deviated from the average records for a particular outlet. When detected, the average value was used as a replacement to maintain data integrity.
2. **Error Message Cells**: During the data transformation phase, certain calculations were necessary to achieve the desired outcomes. Cells containing error messages were identified and eliminated from the dataset to ensure accuracy.

**Data Analysis and Investment Insights:**

This project provided invaluable insights for our clients in the food sector, addressing critical questions essential for strategic decision-making in food manufacturing. The key inquiries included:
1. **Key Insight Report**:
   - What key insights were uncovered regarding market representation and overall product performance during the project period?
2. **Sales Performance Report**:
   - How quickly did their products move in the selected outlets?
   - What was the total sales volume during the analysis period?
   - Which products were the top sellers and which were the bottom sellers?
3. **SOS (Share of Shelf) and OSA (On-Shelf Availability) Report**:
   - What was the capacity of their product representation? Were they struggling with visibility or excelling in it?
4. **Competition Report**:
   - How were their competitors performing? Were they surpassing FCW in product representation, and if so, in what ways?
   - Were competitors running promotions to boost sales?

These critical inquiries form the foundation for informed decision-making in the food sector. Through a comprehensive newsletter created with Looker, derived from thorough dataset analysis, this project illuminates the path for our clients seeking strategic and lucrative opportunities in the ever-evolving world of food manufacturing.
